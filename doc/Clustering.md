## Clustering

### Datasets used as gold standard

| **Dataset** | **Interpretation of clusters** | **Clusters** | **Size** | 
| :---------: | :---------------------: | ----------: | -------: |
|   PersonObjectPlace    |     {Person, Object Place}      |           3 |      540 
| QT900 | {Situation, Statement, Thought} | 3 | 900 |

### Model and its configuration

| **Model** | **Configuration** |
| :---------: | :---------------------: |
| Agglomerative Clustering | similarity_metric |
| Ward Hierarchical Clustering | similarity_metric |
| DBSCAN | similarity_metric |
| k-Means | - |

For each **missing entity** a *singleton cluster* is created, i.e. a cluster which contains only the current entity. 
Further, soft clustering approaches, such as DBscan, do not cluster all entities. 
We call these entities *miss-clustered entities* and manage them exactly as the missing entities, i.e., we create a singleton cluster for each of them.
The evaluation metrics are applied to the combination of the clusters returned by the clustering algorithm and all the **singleton clusters**.

### Output of the evaluation

| **Metric** | **Range** | **Optimum** |
| :---------: | :---------------------: | :----------: |
| Adjusted rand score | [-1,1] | Highest |
| Adjusted mutual info score | [0,1] | Highest |
| Fowlkes Mallow index | [0,1] | Highest |
| v_measure score| [0,1] | Highest |
| Homogeneity score| [0,1] | Highest |
| Completeness score| [0,1] | Highest |
| Accuracy| [0,1] | Highest |
